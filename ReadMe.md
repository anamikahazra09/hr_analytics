# HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

##  Overview

This is an end-to-end HR Analytics project built using **Power BI**, where I analyzed real employee presence data from **AtliQ Technologies**. The goal was to assist the HR team with insightful visualizations for better workforce decision-making.

Through this project, I closely followed a real-world scenario where the HR personnel conveyed specific business requirements, and I built the dashboard accordingly. This project not only highlights my technical proficiency but also showcases my understanding of translating business needs into data-driven insights.

##  Project Structure

### 1. Introduction
The project simulates a real-time business case where an HR from AtliQ Technologies approaches with a need for better visibility into employee presence and behavior patterns. I took this as a consulting-style challenge to design an impactful solution.

### 2. Understanding the HR Requirements
I started by identifying and listing all the core KPIs the HR team was looking for—such as average attendance rate, employee categories, working hours, absenteeism trends, etc. This helped shape the data model and dashboard layout.

### 3. Gathering and Transforming Data
I worked with a real dataset and performed necessary data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor. Tasks included:
- Handling nulls and duplicates
- Standardizing formats
- Merging and splitting data columns
- Creating lookup tables

### 4. Creating Matrix using DAX
I wrote calculated columns and measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to derive meaningful metrics. This included:
- Attendance rates
- Monthly trends
- Dynamic filters for department and employee roles
- Time-intelligence calculations

### 5. Dashboarding
I designed an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Power BI that allows HR to:
- Filter by date, department, and designation
- Track attendance trends over time
- Identify frequent absenteeism
- Compare attendance between different teams

The design emphasizes usability, visual clarity, and responsiveness.

### 6. Closing
The final dashboard was validated against HR's needs and revised based on simulated feedback. This project gave me hands-on experience in end-to-end dashboard development, stakeholder communication, and business-focused analytics.
